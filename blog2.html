                        <br><p>Our collective fascination with houseplants has yielded a crop of uniquely millennial jobs, and plant styling—as in, making a living by decorating homes, offices, and restaurants with carefully selected foliage—sits at the top of that list. It's no secret that plants are scientifically proven to reduce stress, but the coronavirus saw an uptick in the rare-plant market, and nurseries all over the country experienced a boom in sales even before reopening was a consideration. Take one scroll through Instagram and you'll find there's more visibility for plantfluencers, plant professionals, and start-ups in the wake of the pandemic—sparking a recent interior design and lifestyle shift toward greenery.</p>
                        <br>
                        <p>First and foremost, you want to bring in plants that will thrive in your space. “I think a lot of people buy plants for aesthetic reasons, but so much of plant styling is about the environmental conditions,” says Priyanka Padode, décor expert and owner of DezignGenie.. She recommends assessing the natural light in your home as well as your lifestyle, schedule, and experience caring for plants before going to the plant shop. Ask yourself questions like, Does my home receive bright direct, bright indirect, moderate, or low light? Do I have drafty windows? Tons of air conditioning vents? Overpowering heat and humidity? Your answers will help you select the right plants for your space. “All of these environmental factors will impact the health of your plants,” she adds.</p><br>
                        <p>Snake plant complements a high-ceiling room because of its tall-structured leaves. Placing it in an attractive mud or metal pot could add an artsy touch to your living room. If you have a narrow stretch to spare, you could also fix this plant along with some pebbles and stones above a layer of soil to give it an outdoorsy feel!</p><br>
                        <p>Golden pothos usually poses as a gorgeous vine in any space. Placing it on a high shelf and allowing it to cascade naturally is a recommended look with this climber. It’s free-falling characteristic paired with its need for minimal space adds a dainty look to the room.</p><br>
                        <p>Spider plant is less sturdy, hence making it seem shorter and rather bundled. A mid-sized pot for this long-leaved air cleanser is an apt form of its decoration. Due to its huddled look, it seats itself best in a spacious room (usually the living room).</p><br>
                        <p>Dwarf banana is recommended to be placedby a full-length window, as it needs sunlight in abundance while it’s broad radiating leaves make your space seem bigger!</p><br>
                        <p>Now comes the elegant flower Peace lily to enhance any room with a clean and smooth finish! This petite addition to the living room, placed on a decorative console will enhance the look while also cleansing the air. Refreshing indeed…</p><br>
                        <p>Aloe Vera isn’t just used for clear skin, but also clear air! We recommend placing this plant in a secluded corner to avoid a pokey situation. For those interested in a little Feng Shui, quite unlike its prickly texture, it brings harmony and positivity into the room!</p><br>
