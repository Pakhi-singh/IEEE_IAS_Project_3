                        <p>Did you ever ask yourself why trees are so important? Why is everyone talking about reforestation, and why is everyone making such a fuzz when the Amazon burns?Fear not. We have enlisted the top 5 reasons why trees are so incredibly valuable for you. And why they matter so much both for our planet and for us humans, too – no matter where on Earth you live.</p><br>
                        <p>From the delicate willow to the mighty oak, the upright pine to the leggy mangrove, trees are increasingly overlooked. In a world that is spending too much time looking down, not enough of us are looking up.There are so many reasons why trees matter, and why they are awesome. And why we should be looking to protect them.Don’t believe us? Well, in no particular order, here are 10 reasons that explain how important trees are. Take a read and let us know your favorite in the comments below.</p><br>
                        <p>The water cycle is the process by which water falls to the ground as rain. It’s then absorbed by trees and other plants, then released back into the air as transpiration.Constantly ‘drinking’ whenever it can, a single tree will typically release around 250-400 gallons of water back into the air every single day.Therefore trees are crucial for maintaining optimum levels of humidity in our air. They also ensure that the water cycle (which provides the fresh water we rely on to stay alive) remains in balance.The world has established a natural rhythm when it comes to the water cycle. Deforestation severely disrupts this cycle and can put our supplies of fresh water (which makes up just 3% of the planet’s total water) in jeopardy.</p><br>
                        <p>All the way from rainforest care to tree planting. From fruit harvests to biological and botanical research. Trees provide a multitude of jobs. At our project in Ghana, trees also offer the possibility of education for youngsters.Working on the land is a career as old as time. But, as with many other physically taxing jobs, it tends to be work which is reserved for those in lower socio-economic areas.For many small, often rural communities, without trees there would be no way to sustain the local people.While it could be argued that deforestation also creates jobs, this work is not sustainable in the long term. Once the trees are gone, the work is too.Forest conservation and reforestation make up the majority of arboreal jobs in the world. We need to protect these roles for people whose livelihoods depend on it.Or, better yet – create even more of these jobs.</p><br>
                        <p>Surely we don’t have to explain the reasons why forests are vital for wildlife too?A diverse range of birds, insects and mammals live in forest habitats. These creatures have adapted to their environment over centuries and are reliant on it.While the larger or more exciting animals (elephants, tigers, gibbons, macaques, sunbirds or hornbills) may be the first that come to mind, a seemingly simple tree may well be home to hundreds or even thousands more creatures of a much smaller size. Snakes, frogs, millipedes, ants, termites, spiders, beetles, moths – all of them depend on the safety of their forest home.</p><br>
                        <p>Trees play a super important role in improving the quality of the soil around them in numerous ways. As part of their carbon filtering properties, they remove carbon and other noxious substances from the soil, allowing other plants to flourish.Good quality soil should contain no more than 2% carbon. However, in heavily forested areas it can be as low as 0.05%. In fact, land that is surrounded by trees can double crop production thanks to the soil-purifying effect of trees. The better the yield, the less land is needed to feed humanity.Trees also contribute vital minerals to the soil by shedding its foliage and allowing it to decompose as mulch. And lastly, trees improve soil quality by pulling nutrients from deep under the ground up to the surface via the powerful action of their roots. Again, this makes the soil much more nutritious for other plants (including crops).</p><br>
                        <p>Areas that have been deforested are much more vulnerable to desertification. Using their trunks and foliage, trees form a natural barrier to winds and floods. This barrier slows the forces of nature down and helps to prevent bad weather from becoming a natural disaster capable of devastating large areas.Philippines is one country where we focus on planting mangrove trees. These trees create a natural form of protection to the land.Tree roots perform a vital function in holding the soil together, preventing it from erosion. In deforested areas, there is nothing to keep the soil in place or slow the speed of incoming winds or monsoons. A period of high winds or rain is then free to sweep away all of the loose soil, turning the area into a quasi-desert. </p><br>
                        <p>Would you agree that there are many reasons why trees are awesome?Then let’s save our trees! They have a vital role in the future of our planet, which is why it’s so crucial that we protect them.We can do this by contributing to reforestation projects, combating deforestation, sourcing our food, paper, and wooden goods sustainably, and working to reduce our carbon emissions. Small changes can make a big difference.</p>
